          <h3>Turnaround Progress Dashboard</h3>
          <p>Developed a comprehensive, real-time dashboard in Power BI that consolidates critical project data across multiple departments, including Safety, Quality, Schedule, Cost, Delays, and Manpower. The dashboard is automatically updated based on pre-shutdown system configurations, with daily refreshes to ensure that all inputs are current. This tool provides detailed insights into project performance, highlighting key metrics like repair rate, absenteeism, cost overruns, and schedule adherence. It has significantly improved our ability to track and mitigate delays proactively, identify exposure risks, and drive more informed decision-making. The interactive design of the dashboard allows users to easily navigate between different sections, drilling down into specific details for each department, making it an essential tool for both real-time and future project tracking.</p>

          <h3>üè∑Ô∏è Material & Fabrication Process Tracking App</h3>
          <p>Created a barcode-enabled tracking system to manage the end-to-end material and spool fabrication process. The app automates raw material receipt, priority-based allocation to ISOs/BOMs, live progress tracking of fabrication and welds, and QC release. Final spools are dispatched from the fabrication yard and digitally received on-site, ensuring full traceability and transparency from delivery to installation.
